This is a simple text file for jotting down questions/comments/concerns/ideas for the group.

Design patterns needed?
Decorator (rotated, compound, etc.)
Interpreter (generating postscript)

Will made a basic language definition:
<Compound>	::=	Postscript + { <Compound> | <Basic> }
<Basic>		::=	Postscript

Do we need more entries for each shape type? Individual entires for scaled, rotated, etc? Ask Hartman about the language to check.

TDD/YAGNI?
Start with a single shape? Each shape?

Start with a compound shape?
