This is a simple text file for jotting down questions/comments/concerns/ideas for the group.

Design patterns needed?
Decorator (rotated, compound, etc.)
Interpreter (generating postscript)

Will made a basic language definition:
<Compound>	::=	Postscript + { <Compound> | <Basic> }
<Basic>		::=	Postscript

Do we need more entries for each shape type? Individual entires for scaled, rotated, etc? Ask Hartman about the language to check.











Still need spacers, the two compound shapes, and figure out how main will call our stuff.
